# Alcohol Detector with Engine Lock

## Overview
This project is an Arduino-based alcohol detection system designed to enhance vehicle safety. It uses an MQ-3 sensor to detect alcohol levels in the air. If alcohol is detected above a predefined threshold, the system locks the engine (simulated by a motor), activates a buzzer, lights a red LED, and displays a warning on a 16x2 LCD. If no alcohol is detected, the engine runs, a green LED lights up, and a "Drive Safe" message is shown on the LCD.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Uno
- MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor
- 16x2 LCD Display (with I2C module optional)
- DC Motor (to simulate engine)
- Buzzer
- Red LED (for alcohol detection warning)
- Green LED (for safe status)
- 9V Battery (or power supply)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- 2N2222 Transistor (for motor control)

## Pin Connections
- **MQ-3 Sensor**:
  - Digital Output (DO): Pin 2
  - Analog Output (AO): Pin A1
- **LCD**:
  - RS: Pin 8
  - E: Pin 9
  - D4-D7: Pins 4, 5, 6, 7
- **Motor**:
  - Motor Control 1: Pin 12
  - Motor Control 2: Pin 13
- **Buzzer**: Pin A3
- **Red LED**: Pin A2 (can be considered red)
- **Green LED**: Optional

## How to Run the Project
1. Connect the hardware components as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the `AlcoholDetector.ino` sketch to your Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.
3. Power the Arduino (via USB or 9V battery).
4. The LCD will display "Alcohol Detector" during initialization.
5. The system will continuously monitor alcohol levels:
   - If alcohol is detected, the motor stops, the buzzer sounds, the red LED turns on, and the LCD shows "Alcohol Detected, Vehicle Locked."
   - If no alcohol is detected, the motor runs, and the green LED (if used) turns on, and the LCD shows "No Alcohol Detect, Drive Safe."

## Code Explanation
- The MQ-3 sensor reads alcohol levels via analog input (A1).
- The digital output pin is used for threshold detection (LOW = alcohol present).
- If alcohol is detected, the system locks the engine (turns off the motor), activates the buzzer, and lights the red LED.
- Otherwise, the motor runs, and the green LED (if implemented) indicates a safe state.
- The LCD provides real-time feedback to the user.

## Dependencies
- **LiquidCrystal Library**: Ensure this library is installed in your Arduino IDE (`Sketch > Include Library > LiquidCrystal`).
